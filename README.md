### Try it!

To run the Credit Card Number Validator application, follow the instructions in the Setup section below.

## Project Structure

- `luhn_algorithm.py`: Contains the implementation of the credit card number validator using the Luhn algorithm.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/creinis/luhn-algthm-fcc-scicomp-py-cert.git
   cd card-validator
   ```

2. Run the Credit Card Number Validator script:
   ```bash
   python3 luhn_algorithm.py
   ```

## Credit Card Number Validator

### Functionality

The Credit Card Number Validator uses the Luhn algorithm to verify the validity of a given credit card number. The script processes the card number, strips any non-numeric characters, and checks if the number passes the Luhn algorithm check.

### Practical Use Case

This validator can be used in applications that require credit card number validation, such as e-commerce websites, payment processing systems, and any other platform where validating credit card information is necessary. It ensures that the entered credit card numbers are syntactically valid before proceeding with further processing.

### Benefits

- **Accurate Validation:** Uses the Luhn algorithm, a widely accepted method for validating credit card numbers.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple Python script that can be easily integrated into larger applications.
- **Educational Value:** Demonstrates the implementation of the Luhn algorithm in Python, making it a useful example for learning about basic algorithm implementation and validation techniques.
