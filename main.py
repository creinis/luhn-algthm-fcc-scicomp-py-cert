# Step 1

#In this project, you will implement the Luhn Algorithm. 
# This algorithm is a formula to validate a variety of identification numbers.

# Start by declaring a function called main. Use the pass keyword to avoid an error.

def main():
    pass

# Step 2

# Replace the pass statement with a variable named card_number and a value of 4111-1111-4555-1142.

def main():
    card_number = "4111-1111-4555-1142"

# Step 3

# Python comes with built-in classes that can help us with string manipulation. 
# One of them is the str class. It has a method called maketrans that can help us create a translation table. 
# This table can be used to replace characters in a string:

str.maketrans({'t': 'c', 'l': 'b'})
