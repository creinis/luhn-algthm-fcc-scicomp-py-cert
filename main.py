# Step 1

#In this project, you will implement the Luhn Algorithm. 
# This algorithm is a formula to validate a variety of identification numbers.

# Start by declaring a function called main. Use the pass keyword to avoid an error.

def main():
    pass

# Step 2

# Replace the pass statement with a variable named card_number and a value of 4111-1111-4555-1142.

def main():
    card_number = "4111-1111-4555-1142"
